_**Eurydice**_ <br>
*-by Agha Shahid Ali* <br>

I am a woman <br>
brought limping to Hell <br> 

under the Night <br>  
and Fog decree. <br>

But theyâ€™ve let him come <br>
here to Belsen, rare passenger <br>

in a river-green van, <br>
ferried in by an old chauffeur <br>

who drives past <br>
the howl-choked dogs <br>

at the fence. At a shudder <br>
of coals, trains unload <br>

wide-eyed children, <br>
who now flock around him. <br>

Yes, he is here,<br>
he who, people said,<br>

could dissolve bombs<br>
in mid-air<br>

when he played Beethoven.<br>
Now the guards weep<br>

as he begins<br>
his own Dream of Calliope.<br>

The smoke hangs down its arms<br>
over the chimneys,<br>

clearing the ghost-washed air. <br>
Yes, I will soon be<br>

on the train with him,<br>
rushing along the upper Rhine.<br>

But a guard hands him papers,<br>
he has done something, no,<br>

he must not do something,<br>
he leafs<br>

through the papers,<br>
he must not, what?<br>

He is pushed into the van.<br>
His gaze runs through my tears,<br>

stringing them into a necklace<br>
that chokes me<br>

as my farewell<br>
amplifies in a sudden<br>

tunnel of mustard twilight.<br>
