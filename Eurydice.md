_**Eurydice**_
*-by Agha Shahid Ali*

I am a woman <br>
brought limping to Hell <br> 
<br>  

under the Night  
and Fog decree.

But theyâ€™ve let him come
here to Belsen, rare passenger

in a river-green van,
ferried in by an old chauffeur

who drives past
the howl-choked dogs

at the fence. At a shudder
of coals, trains unload

wide-eyed children,
who now flock around him.

Yes, he is here,
he who, people said,

could dissolve bombs
in mid-air

when he played Beethoven.
Now the guards weep

as he begins
his own Dream of Calliope.

The smoke hangs down its arms
over the chimneys,

clearing the ghost-washed air.
Yes, I will soon be

on the train with him,
rushing along the upper Rhine.

But a guard hands him papers,
he has done something, no,

he must not do something,
he leafs

through the papers,
he must not, what?

He is pushed into the van.
His gaze runs through my tears,

stringing them into a necklace
that chokes me

as my farewell
amplifies in a sudden

tunnel of mustard twilight.
